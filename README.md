# Smart Sensor WiFi
## General information

 * Developpement status : *work in progress*

## About the project
This project aims to build a network of sensors which can easily be
deployed into any building to monitor it. The sensors would be able to
monitor temperature, light, moist, presence and so on and send everything
to a centralized database into which data will be stored and processed.

We can easily imagine which use can be done of this kind of sensor networks
in the field of energy-efficient building.

For now, this project is part of a student project led by Polytech'Lille,
a french school of engineering.
